Instructions:

Please visit thinkific.herokuapp.com
and sign up for an account. 

Stack:

Built on Node Js, Express Js with MongoDB deployed on
Heruoku.

Summary:

I choose this stack because it is light weight,
asyncronous and non relational,
which is suitable for this challenge. 

I started with a basic API that gives a token, which
users can use "Postman" to connect to the API. Below are 
the routes for this app:

GET:
home:         which is root
authenticate: which is to authenticate client
signup:       for signing up
profile:      the user profile page

POST:
/update/:user_id/edit  : for updating number with new #
/next/:user_id .       : to get next number

The API is secured through password hashing and middleware
provided by Express.JS

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me, 
feedback is greatly appreciated!

Kind regards,
